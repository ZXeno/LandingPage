# LandingPage
Repository for my personal landing page using ASP.NET Core 2 framework.
This is intended to eventually replace http://signalreceived.com, adding blogging functionality, proper database storage of portfolio data using SQL and file storage, AzureAD Authentication, and future site extensibility through a dashboard rather than needing to manually add additional content or pages.
